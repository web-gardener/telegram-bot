# Telegram_Bot
Using Python, we have built a chatbot on Telegram through python-telegram-bot==13.7 library module. This library provides a pure Python, asynchronous interface for the Telegram Bot API.In addition to the pure API implementation, this library features a number of high-level classes to make the development of bots easy and straightforward. The Task Master(bot) provides different links (consisting of relevant data) based on user request. Steps :

Step 1: Create a Telegram Account

Step 2: Find BotFather in the telegram

Step 3: Open it and Press the start

Step 4: Click on /newbot

Step 5: Now choose the name for the bot

Step 6: And then choose the username for the bot

NOTE: Python 3.7 and above required.

After that, We need to install a library to edit the Telegram bot

Pip install python-telegram-bot

conda install -c conda-forge python-telegram-bot
